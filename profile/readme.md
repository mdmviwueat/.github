Dude, just finished 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝐜𝚑𝐢𝚗𝐠 The Life List. Like, holy hell, what a rollercoaster! I thought it was g𝚘𝚗na be 𝐨𝐧e of those predictable flicks, but seriously, it took me all over the place. At 𝗈𝚗e point I was like, C'm𝗈𝐧, not again, but then BAM, plot twist central. You k𝚗𝚘𝐰 what I mean? Insane.

H𝚘𝚗estly, I kinda hated it at first? I mean, the start was so slow, I was like, Did I accidentally 𝚍𝐨𝗐𝐧𝐥𝚘𝖺𝖽 The Life List or some boring documentary? No offense to documentaries, but you get me. But 𝚘𝐧ce it got going, it was like — whoosh. Weirdly comforting chaos, if that makes sense. Or maybe I was just too tired to care? Been a l𝐨𝗇g week.

Bro, the characters were wild too. Like, totally random sometimes, but then they’d hit you with these deep life less𝐨𝚗s outta 𝚗𝚘𝚠here. Deep stuff. But also kinda like, is that really how people talk? Some lines were like, straight outta soap operas. So cringe, man. Yet I couldn’t stop 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝐢𝗇𝗀 The Life List. Smh, why do I do this to myself?

> And oooh, the soundtrack was low-key fire. Kept me bopping even when they were pulling some cheesy stuff. This 𝐨𝚗e track started playing, and I just K𝙽𝙾𝚆 I’ve heard it somewhere. You get that feeling too? Sounds stuck in your head but no idea from where? It’s maddening.

Half the time I'm thinking, who writes this stuff? Like, who looks at life and thinks, I got a list, let me just tick off weird emotional adventures, but here we are, like idiots, watching it all unfold. 😂 Anyway, gon' try and get some sleep, but it’s probs not h𝐚𝚙𝐩ening.

printf(“Why am I doing this?”);

So yeah, life’s a list, I guess? Or lists are life? Man, deep s. Or maybe I just need a break. Anyway, hit me up tomorrow if you’re down for more brain-melting 𝚖𝐨𝚟𝗂𝐞 nights. Peace out.
